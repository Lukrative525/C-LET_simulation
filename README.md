# C-LET Array Simulation

This repository contains python code originally developed by Luke Gardner for the BYU Compliant Mechanisms Research Group for simulating the deflections of compact lamina-emergent torsional (C-LET) arrays.

## How to Run

Download the project zip file and extract it. Navigate to the folder containing the extracted files and set it as your working directory. Then run `simulation.py`.

### Dependencies

This code requires the `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `PyQt6`, and `scipy` python packages. These are the versions that were used for development:

```
matplotlib 3.10.1
numpy 2.2.3
PyQt6 6.8.2
scipy 1.15.2
```

If you want to run `equations.py` from the *derivation* folder, it will require the `sympy` package. Version 1.13.3 was used for this project.
